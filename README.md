It's a quick way to get Packback-specific Laravel and Lumen microservices bootstrapped and off the ground!
Quickly install Laravel or Lumen, the handful of packages we use, testing with Codeception, and 
set up the folder structure. Yay!

You'll first need to install Yeoman:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

We don't have the generator on npm yet, so for now, pull this repository down and navigate to its folder,
then run:

```bash
npm link
```

This will install the project dependencies and symlink a global module to the local file.

Finally, to run the generator:

```bash
yo laravel-eden
```
